# myVoice
 Assistive-technology desktop app for augmentative and alternative communication
 
 The purpose of this app is to give a voice to people who, because of motor neuron diseases, don't have one.
Any text input by the user will be read outloud by the app, which is built-in with a prediction system 
designed to learn from the user as they use the app.

Since many people with mobility impairment aren't able to make use of a computer keyboard or mouse, myVoice 
was designed to be controlled by either one or two inputs. Te default input mode is:
-Z-key (tab): when pressed, focus moves to the next button/group of buttons
-X-key (enter): when pressed, the item with the focus is selected triggering an action.
This set of keys can be changed to any pair of alphanumeric keys inside the configuration tab. This input 
mode requires the user to be able to control two different keyboard keys.

Input modes with one key or mouse click:
this two modes involve just one input key (or click) pressed in two different ways:
-press and release (tab): focus moves to the next button/group of buttons
-press, hold and release (enter): the item with the focus is selected triggering an action.
This mode can be enabled inside the configuration tab and any alphanumerical key can be selected as the input.
